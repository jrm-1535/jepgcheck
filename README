#jpegcheck

A small tool for checking the validity of jpeg files (JFIF and EXIF), displaying
their content (tables, scans) or in some simple cases fixing errors in data.

A raw RGB picture file can be created after decoding.

Baseline sequential, extended sequential and progressive are supported only
in huffman mode. No arithmetic coding and no hierarchical modes yet.
